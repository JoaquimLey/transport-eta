# Transport ETA

An utility app using an SMS based service (or the web) to request a more precise ETA of a publc-transport (Bus, Metro etc.) to a specific station, currently implementing for Lisbon 🇵🇹, but the idea is to scale up to any other cities around the world that provide the same kind of service(s).

## Some of the cool stuff I'll be integrating in this project:
- Multi module Clean architecture
- Rx
- Kotlin
- Android Architecture Components
- Firebase Suite (I'll integrate as much services as possible)
- Tests  🙌

-----------------------------
#### Built from the ground-up on my twitch channel: [twitch.tv/joaquimley](http:twitch.tv/joaquimley)
--------------------

## Why 🤔
Since I'm always working on some side-projects, I decided to document the development on a live coding stream, this way I'll force myself into finishing more often, and maybe giving something back, or get some feedback from the community.
